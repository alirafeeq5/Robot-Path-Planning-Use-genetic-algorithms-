# Robot-Path-Planning-Use-genetic-algorithms-
This Python code demonstrates a Genetic Algorithm approach for robot path planning in a grid-based environment with obstacles. The algorithm aims to find an optimal path from a start point to an end point while avoiding obstacles.

Instructions

1-Setup:

   •	Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  
   •	Install required libraries (matplotlib) if not already installed.
  
2-Run the Code:

   •	Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script (path_planning.py).
  
   •	Adjust parameters such as start_point, end_point, num_obstacles, population_size, and iterations as needed.
  
   •	Execute the script to run the Genetic Algorithm for robot path planning:

Interpret Results:

   •	The algorithm will generate and evolve a population of paths to find the optimal path from the start point to the end point while avoiding obstacles.
  
   •	The final plot will display the best path found by the Genetic Algorithm.


Example Input

Start Point: (2, 1)

End Point: (15, 16)

Number of Obstacles: 15

Graph Size: 20x20

Population Size: 100

Iterations: 500
